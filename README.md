📘 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to performing Exploratory Data Analysis on a given dataset. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights, detect patterns, and assess data quality before applying machine learning or advanced analytics.

✅ Key Steps Included:

📚 Library Setup – Imports essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
📊 Dataset Preview – Loads the dataset and displays initial rows using .head() to get a quick glimpse of the data.
ℹ Structural Summary – Examines data types, shape, and missing values with methods like .info() and .isnull().sum().
📈 Statistical Summary – Utilizes .describe() to compute summary statistics of numeric columns.
🧹 Handling Missing Data – Detects and optionally addresses missing values that could impact analysis or modeling.
📉 Visual Exploration – Uses a variety of plots—histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, and bar charts—to understand distributions and detect outliers.
🔗 Relationship Analysis – Employs correlation matrices and heatmaps to reveal associations among variables.
📝 Key Observations – Highlights early insights, trends, or issues that may influence preprocessing or model selection.

🎯 Objective:

To explore and assess the dataset’s structure, completeness, and relationships — forming a strong foundation for further data preparation and modeling work.
